# Flow Behavior in Idealized & Realistic Upper Airway

Abstract:
This study investigated the flow characteristics in idealized and realistic upper
airway models during oral inhalation, focusing on their ability to replicate airflow
dynamics and turbulence that impact pharmaceutical aerosol delivery. While ide-
alized airway models, such as the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) model, are
widely used in regulatory testing, they lack anatomical fidelity, potentially un-
derestimating critical features, including the laryngeal jet formation, which are
essential for accurate particle deposition predictions. Understanding the implica-
tions of idealized and realistic models is addressed using Large Eddy Simulations
(LES) at inhalation rates of 15 and 30 L/min. Four airway models were analyzed:
the USP model, the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) model, and two
realistic models reconstructed from CT scans of healthy adults.
The findings revealed the limitations of the USP model. The VCU models ability
to captured laminar flow behaviors with a laryngeal jet with a lower magnitude
compared to the realistic models. The realistic models (R01 and R02) exhibited
complex flow features, including an earlier laryngeal jet formation in R01 when
compared to the VCU and R02 airway models, emphasizing the importance in
understanding not only the limitations of idealised models but also the variation
within realistic models in airflow behaviour.
